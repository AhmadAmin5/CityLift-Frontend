# Frontend Screens and API Usage Map — Uber Clone Lab App

## 1. Purpose

This document finalizes the frontend screens/pages needed for the React + Capacitor app and maps every screen to the REST APIs and Socket.IO events it depends on.

It is designed for parallel development:

1. Frontend team builds screens against a mock server.
2. Backend team implements Node.js + Express APIs using the finalized API contract.
3. The mock server can later be replaced with the real backend without changing frontend request/response shapes.

## 2. Frontend Stack Assumptions

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Web framework | React JS |
| Mobile runtime | Capacitor Android WebView |
| Language | Plain JavaScript, not TypeScript |
| Maps | Mapbox |
| Realtime | Socket.IO client |
| API format | JSON, snake_case keys |
| Base API URL | `/api/v1` |
| Auth | Bearer token stored in app storage |

## 3. Screen Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| P0 | Required for core demo and ride lifecycle |
| P1 | Required for shortlisted features but can be simpler |
| P2 | Admin/demo/analytics screens; useful for lab showcase |

## 4. App Navigation Groups

The app should be organized into these major flows:

1. Auth flow
2. Rider app flow
3. Driver app flow
4. Admin/demo web flow
5. Shared profile/settings flow

A single React app can route users based on `user.role` from `GET /auth/me`.

| Method | Endpoint | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/login` | Submit email/phone and password. |

### Request Fields

```json
{
  "email_or_phone": "ali@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

### Success Navigation

### Request Fields

```json
{
  "name": "Ali Khan",
  "email": "ali@example.com",
  "phone": "+923001234567",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

---

## 5.4 Register Driver Screen

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Priority | P0 |
| Route | `/auth/register/driver` |
| Users | driver |

# 12. Mock Server Requirements for Frontend

The mock server must simulate these flows accurately.

## 12.1 Auth Flow

1. Login returns `access_token`, `user`, and role-specific profile.
2. Register rider returns rider role and rider profile.
3. Register driver returns driver role and driver profile.
4. `GET /auth/me` must return the same logged-in user from mock storage.

## 12.2 Rider Ride Flow

Mock server should support this complete flow:

```text
POST /rides/estimate
POST /rides
GET /rides/:ride_id => status searching_driver
Socket ride:status:update => accepted
GET /rides/:ride_id/live
Socket ride:live:update repeated
Socket ride:status:update => arrived
Socket ride:status:update => started
Socket ride:status:update => completed
GET /rides/:ride_id/receipt
POST /rides/:ride_id/rating
```

## 12.3 Driver Ride Flow

Mock server should support:

```text
PATCH /drivers/me/availability
Socket ride:offer
POST /drivers/me/ride-offers/:offer_id/accept
POST /rides/:ride_id/arrive
POST /rides/:ride_id/start
POST /rides/:ride_id/tracking
POST /rides/:ride_id/complete
GET /drivers/me/earnings
```

## 12.4 Realtime Simulation

For frontend testing, mock Socket.IO should emit:

1. `ride:offer` to online driver.
2. `ride:status:update` to rider and driver.
3. `ride:live:update` every few seconds during active ride.
4. `nearby_drivers:update` on rider home.
5. `surge:update` on map screens.
